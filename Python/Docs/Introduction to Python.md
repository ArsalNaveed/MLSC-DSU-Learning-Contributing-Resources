Intro: Python is a popular high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used for various applications, from web development and scientific computing to data analysis and artificial intelligence. Its syntax emphasizes code readability, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers. Python supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming paradigms, and it has a large standard library that includes modules for handling tasks such as file I/O, networking, and regular expressions.

Now let's explain this code in 3 points:

    Input: The code uses the built-in input() function to take user input for the length and width of the rectangle. The input() function returns a string, which is then converted to float using float() function to ensure that the input is treated as a floating-point number for mathematical calculations.

    Calculation: The code calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width, and storing the result in the variable area. Python uses the * operator for multiplication.

    Output: Finally, the code uses the print() function to display the calculated area of the rectangle. The print() function is a built-in function in Python that displays the specified output on the console. In this case, it displays the text "The area of the rectangle is:" followed by the value stored in the area variable.
